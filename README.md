<h1 align="center" id="title">Reddit Infinite Scroll App</h1>

<p id="description">
  This application is a simple demonstration of fetching and displaying Reddit Hot posts. The app fetches data directly from the Reddit API, ensuring users get the latest posts in real-time.
  With the help of Android's Paging 3 library, the app provides an endless scrolling experience. As users scroll down, more posts are fetched and displayed without any need for manual pagination.
The Room database is integrated to cache the posts, allowing for offline access. </p>
